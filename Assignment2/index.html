<h2>Doctor's Order</h2>
<ul>

<li><strong>High Concept:</strong>
Give the doctor the organs he needs so he can help save (?) people who need new organs!
</li>

<li><strong>Theme:</strong>
I picked the Organ Donor theme for this game.
</li>

<li><strong>Mandated Variety:</strong>
For this prototype, it requires the use of the keyboard and is based on randomness to play the game, but genre wise it doesn't necessarily fit anywhere and the playstyle is ...
</li>

<li><strong>Player Experience Goals:</strong>
It sounds mean but I kind of want the player to have a fun but somewhat stressful game experience. 
It requires you to be quick to give the doctor which organs he wants and if you don't satisfy his wishes then it could lead to a very punishing consequence.
</li>

<li><strong>Gameplay:</strong>
The basic gameplay is that the doctor will randomly ask for an organ (lung, brain, etc.) and you must hit the right key that gives the doctor the organ he is asking for. 
If you give him the wrong organ, he will put a checkmark to indicate that you messed up and if you mess up too much then it is game over for he finds you unreliable and it risks losing patients. 
You really have to pay attention and get comfortable with the organs and their key bindings in order to rack up the most points (patients saved) in order to stay in the business of finding organs. 
I really wish I could've made the difficulty start at a lower level at the beginning by making the player only have to work with 3 organs and over time the speed at which the doctor requests organs increases as well as the number of organs to work with slowly increasing.
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Goal:</strong>
By hitting the keyboard the player's character tosses the organ linked to the keyboard input to the doctor and your score/chances change depending on whether the thrown item matches the requested item or not.
</li>

<li><strong>Features:</strong>
It has unique assets and a different tone to the game by making it feel more dark. The feeling that you're in a setting 
where you probably shouldn't be doing this is different. And the quicktime events are challenging yet straightforward.
</li>

<li><strong>Setting/Premise:</strong>
People need organs all the time and we all know that there can be a dark side to it all. Nonetheless, even they have strict requirements for the person who gives them the organ and 
if you don't give them the correct organ quickly, then they can get in trouble (and get arrested) for ruining people's lives! If you don't keep up then you have no chance in the organ selling community.
</li>

<li><strong>Story:</strong>
Sometimes, you have to get things that the people need quickly. 
But it comes at a price of getting it from people who are in no place of getting you these things. 
Things like organs and that's who you are. You're not a doctor nor do you have any medical history yet here you are. 
You have the stuff we need and the people need it now and fast. So let's see if you can keep up with the doctor 
and give him and his patients the thing they need. But your reputation as an organ seller depends on me, so if 
you can't keep up with me, consider yourself fired and your reputation ruined. Think you can handle it?
</li>

<li><strong>Target Audience:</strong>
I think this game would be the most fun for early teens. I feel that mid to late teens could also enjoy it but it has the simplicity of CoolMath games which really rezonates with my younger self!
</li>

<li><strong>Play Time:</strong>
It depends on how long the player can keep up with the requests! It could last from anywhere between a minute to even five (or even forever if you really tried and wanted to)!
</li>

<li><strong>Strategies:</strong>
Paying attention and getting familiar with the keybindings would be the key to success of getting far in this game. 
Without getting familiar with what key goes to what organ, you may mess up the requests often and the doctor could fire you!
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Assets:</strong>
I made all the assets in this game!!!
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Closest Other Game:</strong>
Any flash game or mini game where you have to give the person what they are asking for in a short amount of time. 
A lot of cooking/food based games are similar to this!
