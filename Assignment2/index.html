<h2>Doctor's Order</h2>
<ul>

<li><strong>High Concept:</strong>
Give the doctor the organs he needs so he can help save (?) people who need new organs!
</li>

<li><strong>Theme:</strong>
I picked the Organ Donor theme for this game.
</li>

<li><strong>Mandated Variety:</strong>
For this prototype, it requires the use of the keyboard and is based on randomness to play the game, but genre wise it doesn't necessarily fit anywhere and the playstyle is ...
</li>

<li><strong>Player Experience Goals:</strong>
It sounds mean but I kind of want the player to have a fun but somewhat stressful game experience. 
It requires you to be quick to give the doctor which organs he wants and if you don't satisfy his wishes then it could lead to a very punishing consequence.
</li>

<li><strong>Gameplay:</strong>
The basic gameplay is that the doctor will randomly ask for an organ (lung, brain, etc.) and you must hit the right key that gives the doctor the organ he is asking for. 
If you give him the wrong organ, he will put a checkmark to indicate that you messed up and if you mess up too much then it is game over for he finds you unreliable and it risks losing patients. 
You really have to pay attention and get comfortable with the organs and their key bindings in order to rack up the most points (patients saved) in order to stay in the business of finding organs. 
I really wish I could've made the difficulty start at a lower level at the beginning by making the player only have to work with 3 organs and over time the speed at which the doctor requests organs increases as well as the number of organs to work with slowly increasing.
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Goal:</strong>
What game mechanic is this prototype evaluating?
</li>

<li><strong>Features:</strong>
What are the unique aspects of your game that set it apart?
</li>

<li><strong>Setting/Premise:</strong>
A paragraph about the world your game is set in and who the characters are. What makes the game world and its occupants unique and interesting? Do the tokens represent something? If the game has a backstory, put it here. If the game is abstract, then say so.
</li>

<li><strong>Story:</strong>
If the game has a story (or you envision a story for the full game), summarize it in a paragraph. How will the dramatic tension interact with the gameplay tension?
</li>

<li><strong>Target Audience:</strong>
A single sentence that describes the demographic you're trying to reach.
</li>

<li><strong>Play Time:</strong>
It depends on how long the player can keep up with the requests! It could last from anywhere between a minute to even five (or even forever if you really tried and wanted to)!
</li>

<li><strong>Strategies:</strong>
Paying attention and getting familiar with the keybindings would be the key to success of getting far in this game. 
Without getting familiar with what key goes to what organ, you may mess up the requests often and the doctor could fire you!
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Assets:</strong>
I made all the assets in this game!!!
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Closest Other Game:</strong>
Which other game most closely resembles your game? If you are borrowing code from a Phaser Example, you must say so here. If you borrow code from elsewhere, you must say so here.
