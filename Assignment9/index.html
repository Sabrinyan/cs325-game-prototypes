<h2>Pet Match Up!</h2>
<ul>

<li><strong><a href="./Assignment7">Original Version</a></strong></li>

<li><strong>What's new?</strong>
There isn't much visual update to the game but there is a new addition to how the game is played. 
Instead of the game randomly switching cards, the player now gets to switch the cards around! I 
think it will add another layer to the fun of the game, making it frustratingly fun for both players 
as they both lose track of what cards they have switched. On top of that, animal noises were added 
so that everytime a pet is revealed, that pet's noise will be played.
</li>

<li><strong>High Concept:</strong>
Match all the scurrying pets together to get a promotion at the pet store!
</li>

<li><strong>Theme:</strong>
Pet shop
</li>

<li><strong>Mandated Variety:</strong>
This game is built with randomness but it does not require randomness to win the game and requires a sense of strategy! 
It is a 2 player puzzle card game with a competitive play style which requires the mouse to select the cards.
</li>

<li><strong>Player Experience Goals:</strong>
I hope there is a sense of challenge for both players as they try to get more matches than the other! 
It will really be a test of who has the better memory and I hope both players have fun with the random 
and memory aspect of the game!
</li>

<li><strong>Gameplay:</strong>
The gameplay of this game is that two players must take turns and hope that the animal cards match. If 
they don't match, then it is the other player's turn and the cards get flipped back again. If they do 
match, then the player gets to keep the cards but then it is the next player's turn. However, every time a 
player goes, two of the cards picked by the player randomly switch places.
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Goal:</strong>
The goal is to have players keep track of where the animal last was but to also not depend too much 
on what they last saw because you never know when they will switch up on you!
</li>

<li><strong>Features:</strong>
Every turn, two cards/animals randomly switch places (animals are always scurrying so staying in one place 
seems pretty silly to me).
</li>

<li><strong>Setting/Premise:</strong>
The setting is a pet shop and you are trying to match up and organize more pets than your opponent to get 
a promotion at the pet store.
</li>

<li><strong>Story:</strong>
You and your co-worker both know that the manager is thinking about promoting one person. Recently some pets 
have come in and you two have to place them in their proper places at the pet shop. The two of you must 
compete in order to get more animals in their correct place than the other in order to win the promotion!
</li>

<li><strong>Target Audience:</strong>
The target audience is for kids in elementary school and older!
</li>

<li><strong>Play Time:</strong>
The play time should not be too long! I give it a couple minutes depending on the players' speed!
</li>

<li><strong>Strategies:</strong>
Having a good memory would be very helpful because you may end up matching up the animals 
but don't depend too much on it!
