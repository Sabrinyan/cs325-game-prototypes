<h2>Your game title</h2>
<ul>

<li><strong>High Concept:</strong>
There are a bunch of flaming rocks (???) hurdling towards Earth and you're the only cowboy that can stop the end of the world!
</li>

<li><strong>Theme:</strong>
I attempted to incorporate both the "Cowboy" and the "Asteroid hurdling towards Earth" theme.
</li>

<li><strong>Mandated Variety:</strong>
It is basically an infinitely side-scrolling game where the character you play as is in one spot the entire time and you shoot at the infinitely spawning rocks that are falling faster every 5 asteroids or so.
</li>

<li><strong>Player Experience Goals:</strong>
I hope that the player enjoys the game and finds it bizarre yet simple.
It's not a very challenging game but I hope it is engaging enough that they'd want to at least beat their score a couple times over.
</li>

<li><strong>Gameplay:</strong>
The only real mechanic in the game is that the player can point and shoot using their mouse cursor at the asteroids falling out of the sky.
The asteroids spawn at a random location from the top and fall towards the Earth and if it hits the Earth then it's game over.
The general point of the game itself is for the player to keep up with the slowly progressive rate of the asteroids falling towards earth and hope that no asteroid hits the Earth.
Additions I would've liked to make in the game is for the player to move around to make it a more engaging game.
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Goal:</strong>
I feel that the main mechanic the game is evaluating is to pay attention and having quick reactions in order to continue playing the game.
</li>

<li><strong>Features:</strong>
There's not a lot to it and it's a very simple concept but the character appearances are unique and it looks very goofy and biazarre so in that sense I think it is rather unique.
</li>

<li><strong>Setting/Premise:</strong>
The setting is much like the concept: there are asteroids hurdling towards Earth and the pistol the Cowboy has is oddly strong enough to destroy any massive object that is a threat to mankind.
With his trusty donkey sidekick, they are capable of keeping the Earth safe from any harm whether it be a giant rock or maybe a future alien invasion (??????)!
</li>

<li><strong>Story:</strong>
No story sadly, but the donkey loves saving the world :)
</li>

<li><strong>Target Audience:</strong>
Anybody who is wanting to kill time but probably between 7- 13.
</li>

<li><strong>Play Time:</strong>
Fairly long, you could honestly stop whenever. But once the speed is too fast then it may get more difficult and hard to keep up with.
</li>

<li><strong>Strategies:</strong>
Predicting where the asteroid will be when the bullet reaches the location it is headed to will be key to making sure you prevent the asteroid from hitting the ground!
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Assets:</strong>
All assets are made by me using Paint and MediBang Paint Pro. Sound/music were created in LMMS.
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Closest Other Game:</strong>
Probably any flash game. I don't think I've ever really played a game like this but I am sure there are a lot like this (on mobile particularly).
