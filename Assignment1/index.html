<h2>Your game title</h2>
<ul>

<li><strong>High Concept:</strong>
There are a bunch of flaming rocks (???) hurdling towards Earth and you're the only cowboy that can stop the end of the world!
</li>

<li><strong>Theme:</strong>
I attempted to incorporate both the "Cowboy" and the "Asteroid hurdling towards Earth" theme.
</li>

<li><strong>Mandated Variety:</strong>
It is basically an infinitely side-scrolling game where the character you play as is in one spot the entire time and you shoot at the infinitely spawning rocks that are falling.
</li>

<li><strong>Player Experience Goals:</strong>
I hope that the player enjoys the game and finds it bizarre yet simple. It's not a very challenging game but I hope it is engaging enough that they'd want to at least beat their score a couple times over.
</li>

<li><strong>Gameplay:</strong>
The only real mechanic in the game is that the player can point and shoot using their mouse cursor at the asteroids falling out of the sky. The asteroids spawn at a random location from the top and fall towards the Earth and if it hits the Earth then it's game over. The general point of the game itself is for the player to keep up with the slowly progressive rate of the asteroids falling towards earth and hope that no asteroid hits the Earth. Additions I would've liked to make in the game is for the player to move around to make it a more engaging game.
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Goal:</strong>
I feel that the main mechanic the game is evaluating is to pay attention and having quick reactions in order to continue playing the game.
</li>

<li><strong>Features:</strong>
What are the unique aspects of your game that set it apart?
</li>

<li><strong>Setting/Premise:</strong>
A paragraph about the world your game is set in and who the characters are. What makes the game world and its occupants unique and interesting? Do the tokens represent something? If the game has a backstory, put it here. If the game is abstract, then say so.
</li>

<li><strong>Story:</strong>
If the game has a story (or you envision a story for the full game), summarize it in a paragraph. How will the dramatic tension interact with the gameplay tension?
</li>

<li><strong>Target Audience:</strong>
A single sentence that describes the demographic you're trying to reach.
</li>

<li><strong>Play Time:</strong>
How long does your game take to play?
</li>

<li><strong>Strategies:</strong>
What player strategies do you expect will be effective at playing this game?
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Assets:</strong>
All assets are made by me using Paint and MediBang Paint Pro. Sound/music were created in LMMS.
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Closest Other Game:</strong>
Which other game most closely resembles your game? If you are borrowing code from a Phaser Example, you must say so here. If you borrow code from elsewhere, you must say so here.
