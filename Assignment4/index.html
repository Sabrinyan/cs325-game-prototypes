<h2>Your game title</h2>
<ul>

<li><strong>High Concept:</strong>
Stop the noises from playing to keep your stress down but dont pick up the phone because answering it is the most stressful!
</li>

<li><strong>Theme:</strong>
Phone calls aren't returned
</li>

<li><strong>Mandated Variety:</strong>
Input requires the mouse, is not random, and the genre does not fit in any of the already declared genres.
</li>

<li><strong>Player Experience Goals:</strong>
I want the player to experience stress like the character they are playing. 
The noises are really annoying and getting caught up on it could make it hard but more the reason to want to make it stop!
</li>

<li><strong>Gameplay:</strong>
The gameplay of the game is simple: just simply click on the object that seems to be making the noise and make it stop in order to keep your stress down. 
However, picking up the phone is super stressful so make sure not to pick up the phone or get stuck in a possibly stressful converstion with someone. 
If you pick up the phone, it is gameover. Other than that, try to keep the stress from building up.
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Goal:</strong>
The goal of the prototype is to make micromanaging and paying attention an important aspect in winning the game. 
Hopefully, the players try their hardest to prevent their stress from going up which in a sense is stressful as 
well.
</li>

<li><strong>Features:</strong>
I think it is somewhat of a realistic experience for many people that if there is too much noise, 
they go into sensory overload and could potentially get stressed from it. On top of that, personally, I find 
phone calls to be stressful so having a phone call would make me feel stressed and I know many also feel the 
same way so I feel there is a sense of realism (or as much realism as there can be) in this game.
</li>

<li><strong>Setting/Premise:</strong>
A child is home alone and all these objects keep making noises. Listening to it can get stressful so make the sound stop when you can by clicking on it. 
But don't answer the phone because that'll just make matters worse and then you're just gonna be stuck on the phone and 
things will continue to make noise.
</li>

<li><strong>Story:</strong>
Timmy is home alone because his mother went to the grocery store. Once she leaves, the house goes nuts and everything 
seems to be making noises now! Maybe the house is haunted but that's besides the fact. All these sounds are 
ridiculously annoying and he needs to put a stop to it. If he lets it ring then it'll just make his life miserable! 
Everything but the phone that is! Never under any circumstance pick up the phone because then the telemarketers 
won't be quiet and his stressful life reached its maximum level.
</li>

<li><strong>Target Audience:</strong>
Demographic for anybody who can handle all the annoying noises!
</li>

<li><strong>Play Time:</strong>
Depends on how well the player is at continuing the game. Although players may stop wanting to play 
after some time for the sounds may actually be stressful to listen to for long periods!
</li>

<li><strong>Strategies:</strong>
Quick reactions are always good to know to make sure you can stop the sound in time! But be aware 
or else you may end up in a call with someone!
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Assets:</strong>
Everything is made by me!
</li>

Which other game most closely resembles your game? If you are borrowing code from a Phaser Example, you must say so here. If you borrow code from elsewhere, you must say so here.
