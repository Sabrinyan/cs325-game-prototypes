<h2>Your game title</h2>
<ul>

<li><strong>High Concept:</strong>
Stop the noises from playing to keep your stress down but dont pick up the phone because answering it is the most stressful!
</li>

<li><strong>Theme:</strong>
Phone calls aren't returned
</li>

<li><strong>Mandated Variety:</strong>
Input requires the mouse, is not random, and the genre does not fit in any of the already declared genres.
</li>

<li><strong>Player Experience Goals:</strong>
I want the player to experience stress like the character they are playing. 
The noises are really annoying and getting caught up on it could make it hard but more the reason to want to make it stop!
</li>

<li><strong>Gameplay:</strong>
The gameplay of the game is simple: just simply click on the object that seems to be making the noise and make it stop in order to keep your stress down. 
However, picking up the phone is super stressful so make sure not to pick up the phone or get stuck in a possibly stressful converstion with someone. 
If you pick up the phone, it is gameover. Other than that, try to keep the stress from building up.
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Goal:</strong>
What game mechanic is this prototype evaluating?
</li>

<li><strong>Features:</strong>
What are the unique aspects of your game that set it apart?
</li>

<li><strong>Setting/Premise:</strong>
A paragraph about the world your game is set in and who the characters are. What makes the game world and its occupants unique and interesting? Do the tokens represent something? If the game has a backstory, put it here. If the game is abstract, then say so.
</li>

<li><strong>Story:</strong>
If the game has a story (or you envision a story for the full game), summarize it in a paragraph. How will the dramatic tension interact with the gameplay tension?
</li>
