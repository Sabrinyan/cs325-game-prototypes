<h2>Maze Race!</h2>
<ul>

<li><strong>High Concept:</strong>
Roll the die and move that many spaces to advance through the maze but hope that you can get through it faster than your opponent!
</li>

<li><strong>Theme:</strong>
Random - Maze
</li>

<li><strong>Mandated Variety:</strong>
The amount of moves that one can move is randomized but there is a sense of puzzle/strategy by making sure you can beat the maze faster than the opponent. 
There are multiple paths so hopefully you found one of the faster paths!
</li>

<li><strong>Player Experience Goals:</strong>
I hope the players feel a sense of competition and challenge as they navigate through my maze!
</li>

<li><strong>Gameplay:</strong>
The game randomly selects a player to go first where the heart is player 1 and the star is player 2. That person rolls the die then gets to move that many spaces. 
From then on, the players take turns on rolling the die and moving their pieces. Whoever beats the maze first wins!
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Goal:</strong>
I hope that in the future I can add additions to the maze that make it harder - like a dark mode where the pieces can only view the 8 spaces around them.
</li>

<li><strong>Features:</strong>
The players must wait their turn to beat the other person in the maze so it's a game of patience, luck, and strategy!
</li>

<li><strong>Setting/Premise:</strong>
The setting is that you and your competition is in a maze and must beat the other in getting out of it.
</li>

<li><strong>Story:</strong>
There's not really much of a story :c
</li>

<li><strong>Target Audience:</strong>
Any age! I think it may be harder for very young kids because mazes may be beyond them but I'd like to think most everybody can play!
</li>

<li><strong>Play Time:</strong>
Maybe 5 minutes tops!
</li>

<li><strong>Strategies:</strong>
Making sure you have an idea of which path you want to take would be goo!
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Assets:</strong>
Assets are all made by me!
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Closest Other Game:</strong>
Any maze/puzzle game !
