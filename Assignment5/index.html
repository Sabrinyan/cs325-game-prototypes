<h2>Pick a door! (Don't die though!)</h2>
<ul>

<li><strong><a href="Assignment3">Original Version</a></strong></li>

<li><strong>What's new?</strong>
The changes made are now in the description below but I wanted to dedicate a section to changed in the game. 
In this version of the game, instead of the mouse, the game requires the player to use the arrow keys and the 
enter key to select their doors. The rules have not changed but there is a new addition to the game that may 
change how you pick doors. There is now a hint system in the game (the glowing affect) that will select a door 
that has a 75% chance of being the correct door. I made it 75% so that the player does not simply abuse the 
power and actually make decisions not based entirely off the hints. The hints do go away after the first 7 
levels however, so hope that luck is still on your side! There is also audio playing in the game now to raise 
the tension of the game.
</li>

<li><strong>High Concept:</strong>
Three doors lie ahead of you and you're gonna have to get through the right ones in order to live. Good luck!
</li>

<li><strong>Theme:</strong>
Guessing game gone wrong
</li>

<li><strong>Mandated Variety:</strong>
This game is completely random and requires the arrow keys and the enter key to play.
It doesn't necessarily fit in a genre but I suppose it fits somewhat in the achiever playstyle for you hope to achieve living.
</li>

<li><strong>Player Experience Goals:</strong>
I hope the player gets a little frustrated in the sense that they would want to try again and again to see if they can guess through all 10 levels!
</li>

<li><strong>Gameplay:</strong>
So the basic gameplay is that you must select one of the doors and hope it's the right door.
If it is right then you get to go to the next level/room and you must do 10 levels/room of it. 
There is also a time limit at each level so one cannot stay in one room for too long. 
I really wanted to make it looked as though if a monster was chasing you and you had to enter the right doors to escape it. 
I feel that if that were the case a cool story could be made from it!

New Addition: The game now has a hint system where a glowing door indicates a more than likely correct door. However, 
the door may be wrong and going through the hint door may actually lead to death so don't abuse your hints too much!
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Goal:</strong>
The goal of the prototype is to add more to it to make it more engaging and make it seem like you really want to survive and want to save your life.
</li>

<li><strong>Features:</strong>
It does not give you second chances and once you die you must start from scratch. In a sense it is somewhat punishing.
</li>

<li><strong>Setting/Premise:</strong>
It's pretty abstract! But the setting is similar to the story. You're in multiple levels of room and you must escape.
</li>

<li><strong>Story:</strong>
The story is that you are deep within multiple rooms and you need to escape. If you don't escape you will die (maybe from a monster or an unknown) 
but if you also guess and enter the wrong door then you could also risk losing your life. So hope for the best and try to escape as fast as you can. 
Don't get caught but act fast.
</li>

<li><strong>Target Audience:</strong>
There is no target audience but the whole death thing seems very harsh so I feel that you should be at least in middle school.
</li>

<li><strong>Play Time:</strong>
Very quick! At most 110 seconds but I'm sure many would play it faster than that.
</li>

<li><strong>Strategies:</strong>
None other than good luck!
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Assets:</strong>
Assets are created by me!
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Closest Other Game:</strong>
Any guessing game really! Except the cost is a lot higher.
