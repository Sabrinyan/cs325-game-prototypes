<h2>Your game title</h2>
<ul>

<li><strong>High Concept:</strong>
Three doors lie ahead of you and you're gonna have to get through the right ones in order to live. Good luck!
</li>

<li><strong>Theme:</strong>
Guessing game gone wrong
</li>

<li><strong>Mandated Variety:</strong>
This game is completely random and only requires only the mouse to play. 
It doesn't necessarily fit in a genre but I suppose it fits somewhat in the achiever playstyle for you hope to achieve living.
</li>

<li><strong>Player Experience Goals:</strong>
I hope the player gets a little frustrated in the sense that they would want to try again and again to see if they can guess through all 10 levels!
</li>

<li><strong>Gameplay:</strong>
So the basic gameplay is that you must click on one of the doors and hope it's the right door.
If it is right then you get to go to the next level/room and you must do 10 levels/room of it. 
There is also a time limit at each level so one cannot stay in one room for too long. 
I really wanted to make it looked as though if a monster was chasing you and you had to enter the right doors to escape it. 
I feel that if that were the case a cool story could be made from it!
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Goal:</strong>
The goal of the prototype is to add more to it to make it more engaging and make it seem like you really want to survive and want to save your life.
</li>

<li><strong>Features:</strong>
It does not give you second chances and once you die you must start from scratch. In a sense it is somewhat punishing.
</li>

<li><strong>Setting/Premise:</strong>
It's pretty abstract! But the setting is similar to the story. You're in multiple levels of room and you must escape.
</li>

<li><strong>Story:</strong>
The story is that you are deep within multiple rooms and you need to escape. If you don't escape you will die (maybe from a monster or an unknown) 
but if you also guess and enter the wrong door then you could also risk losing your life. So hope for the best and try to escape as fast as you can. 
Don't get caught but act fast.
</li>

<li><strong>Target Audience:</strong>
There is no target audience but the whole death thing seems very harsh so I feel that you should be at least in middle school.
</li>

<li><strong>Play Time:</strong>
Very quick! At most 110 seconds but I'm sure many would play it faster than that.
</li>

<li><strong>Strategies:</strong>
None other than good luck!
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Assets:</strong>
Assets are created by me!
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Closest Other Game:</strong>
Any guessing game really! Except the cost is a lot higher.
